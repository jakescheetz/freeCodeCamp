# Applied Visual Design Notes 
> Jacob Scheetz, 2022


### Text Manipulation & Styling
- different 'text-align' properties can be used to move text into different configurations 
- the 'strong' tags will bold words
- the 'u' tags underline words
- the 'em' tags emphasize text
    - both of the above can be done with the text-decoration CSS property
- the 'hr' tag creates a horizontal line underneath the line, almost like a title bar
    - see 'create-a-horizontal-line-using-the-hr-element.txt'
- you can use rgba() formatting to set the opacity of an element
- the shadow-box property can apply a shadow effect to a box, to see further syntax, see 'add-a-box-element-to-a-card.txt'
#### Opacity
- ranges from 0-1
- the value 1, is not see through
- the value 0 is completely see through 
- 0.5 would be half see through
