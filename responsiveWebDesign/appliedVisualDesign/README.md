# Applied Visual Design Notes 
> Jacob Scheetz, 2022


### Text Manipulation & Styling
- different 'text-align' properties can be used to move text into different configurations 
- the 'strong' tags will bold words
- the 'u' tags underline words
- the 'em' tags emphasize text
    - both of the above can be done with the text-decoration CSS property
- the 'hr' tag creates a horizontal line underneath the line, almost like a title bar
    - see 'create-a-horizontal-line-using-the-hr-element.txt'
- you can use rgba() formatting to set the opacity of an element
- the shadow-box property can apply a shadow effect to a box, to see further syntax, see 'add-a-box-element-to-a-card.txt'
- we can change the line spacing with 'line-height'
- using the position poroperty we can change the positioning of an element either relative to other elements on the page or give it an absolute position on the page
    - top, bottom, left, right can be used in combination with the position property to offset the element in one direction or the other
    - important note: these move inversely. So if you want to move something to the right, you need to offset it with the left property
- we can lock an element to the screen with the fixed property
    - this is like a navbar that stays at the top of the screen as you scroll dow. 
    - see 'lock-an-element-to-the-browser-window-with-fixed-positioning.txt'
#### Opacity
- ranges from 0-1
- the value 1, is not see through
- the value 0 is completely see through 
- 0.5 would be half see through

### Pseudo Classes
- pseudo classes will perform an action or change the styling of a class based on a specific state that it is in
    - i.e. if someone is hovering over a link with a mouse, create a pop up
- see 'adjust-the-hover-state-of-an-anchor-tag.txt'
